Hello! [We](https://github.com/orgs/ecosystem-people/people) are TDD-ing an ecosystem simulator. Then we will be able model things like [trophic cascades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_cascade), [Malthusian traps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_trap), and [Lanchester's Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanchester%27s_laws). Also playing God. To date, this is CLI-only.

Before doing anything activate the virtual environment.

To run unit tests:
```
python -m unittest discover <test_directory_name>
```
